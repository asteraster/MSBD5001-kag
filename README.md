The dataset is from the smart city.
The file is divide into 3 parts
1. feature engineering for day, holiday etc
2. fit into the XGBoost model 
3. Evaluate the performance: mean_absolute_error =4.9,mean_absolute_percentage_error=22%

Although the performance is not good enough, i believe more feature extraction would help to improve.
